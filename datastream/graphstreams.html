									<h2>What are graph streams?</h2>

									<p> A graph stream refers to the graph with edges being updated sequentially in a form of a stream. </p>						
	
									<h2>What are the typical applications?</h2>
									<p>In network traffic data, a node is an IP address (possibly) associated with a port number, and an edge is a message that one IP sent to another IP. In social networks, a node is a unique profile, and an edge could be a relationship or a message between 
									two persons.
									</p>

									<h2>Key Technology</h2>

									<p> Due to the sheer volume and highly dynamic nature of graph streams, the practical way of handling them is by summarization. Given a graph stream G, directed or undirected, the problem of graph stream summarization is to summarize G as Sg with a much smaller (sublinear) space, linear construction time and constant maintenance cost for each edge update, such that Sg allows many queries over G to be approximately conducted efficiently. The widely used practice of summarizing data streams is to treat each stream element independently by e.g., hash- or sample-based methods, without maintaining the connections (or relationships) between elements. Hence, existing methods can only solve ad-hoc problems, without supporting diversified and complicated analytics over graph streams. We present TCM, a generalized graph stream summary. Given an incoming edge, it summarizes both node and edge information in constant time. Consequently, the summary forms a graphical sketch where edges capture the connections inside elements, and nodes maintain relationships across elements.  </p>
