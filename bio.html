							<h2>BIO</h2>	
							<p>
								Dr. Nan Tang is a senior scientist at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), HBKU, Doha, Qatar. 

								<br>
								Prior to joining QCRI in Dec 2011, He was a Research Fellow at LFCS (Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science) at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK (2010--2011). He was a scientific staff member with the CWI (Dutch National Research Center for Mathematics and Computer Science), Amsterdam, Netherlands (2008--2010). He got his PhD. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China (2007). He holds a visiting position at University of Waterloo, Canada (03/2007-08/2007).

							<h2>Collaborators</h2>	
							<p>
								No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it. I am really grateful to have the opportunities to work with the best talents in the world.

								<br><br>

								<b>Michael Stonebraker, MIT (2015-)</b>: We initiated the project <a href="http://dsail.csail.mit.edu/index.php/data-civilizer/">Data Civilizer</a> from 2015, with the goal to build a data preparation tool to find, ingest, clean, and integrate diverse datasets. The unique lesson learned from this 2015 Turing award winner is how to make data systems work for real applications. Of course, this requires to interact with real users from (non-IT) companies, such as Merck and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to understand and solve their daily problems.

								<br><br>

								<b>Sam Madden, MIT (2015-)</b>: We started this collaboration in the same Data Civilizer project. Although Sam is an expert in database management systems, he is also super knowledgeable in many other areas such machine learning, program synthesis and computer systems. When talking with Sam, you really have to think fast to catch up his ideas!

								<br><br>

								<b>Armando Solar-Lezama, MIT (2016-)</b>: Armando is an expert in programming synthesis, a research area that lies at the intersection of programming systems and artificial intelligence. Working with an expert from a different research background can not only open my eyes for new technologies and new tools, but also trigger a new way of thinking. The first project (called Synthesizer) we have been working on, together with Sam Madden and an MIT Ph.D. Rohit Singh, is to use program synthesis to synthesize Generic Boolean Formulas as rules for entity resolution (see more details in the <a href="http://da.qcri.org/ntang/pubs/synthesizer.pdf">paper</a>). The second project (called Castor), together with Sam Madden and another MIT Ph.D. Jack Feser, is to extend the relational algebra with layout operators that describe the particular data items to be stored and the layout of that data in memory, as well as providing a set of equivalence preserving transformations which can transform both the query and the data layout (see more details in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03229.pdf">paper</a>).
